- 👋 Hi, I’m @rocravt
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff... some of it: Web-Dev(React/Online Stores), Blockchains(everything about them: crypto-currencies, NFTs, DeFi, etc...), AI/ML, and almost all topic in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python anf c++. Also, I'm re-learning web-dev, cuz I never properly went through it completely.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects really, at this moment. I just need to get used to GitHub and get proper development experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: crovtbox@gmail.com; Twitter/Telegram/Instagram -> @ravshanbxk
