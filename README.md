- 👋 Hi, I’m @rocravt
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff... some of it: web (React/Online Stores), Blockchains (everything about them: crypto-currencies, NFTs, DeFi, etc...), AI/ML, and everything/anything exciting. We're building stuff after all.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, c++, web (refreshing my HTML/CSS, and will learn JS soon)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on somehting cool
- 📫 How to reach me: crovtbox@gmail.com; @ravshanbxk on Instagram, Twitter, Telegram. Might make a YT channel soon, and a website is slowly on the way.
